========================
WHAT IS ETHICAL HACKING?
========================

In this course we'll learn theory, then put 
it into practice

We'll start with the basics, and progress 
to more Intermediate and challenging projects 
towards the end of the course 

Our goal is to find vulnerabilities and secure them, 
as an ethical hacker that's our main modus operandi, 
we help secure systems to keep them safe 

By systems we mean, computers, servers, websites, 
any computer that needs to be evaluated for 
vulnerabilities and secured 

Why is this important? 

There are many hackers that are not acting in 
good faith, that is the hard-line between an 
ethical hacker, and a malicious hacker

==========
PERMISSION
==========

Ethical hackers are allowed permission to hack 
a company or whoever's system to look for and 
patch vulnerabilities

Servers, databases, computers, the goal is to 
ensure that data is secure 

========
PHISHING
========

Phishing is a method employed by hackers, tricking 
you to get enter login info into fake versions 
of websites you normally go to 

If you look at the address URL, if it doesn't look 
like the proper url, maybe there's a typo, or it's 
not using https, and doesn't have the lock symbol 
those are some clues , but these can also be 
manipulated, so relying on this alone is not 
sufficient
