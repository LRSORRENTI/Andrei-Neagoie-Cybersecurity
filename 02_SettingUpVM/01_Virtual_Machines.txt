============================================
Virtual Machines for our hacking environment
============================================

I'll add a quick preface before I start taking notes,
after completing The Odin Project, I'm familiar 
with VM's a bit, we set up Xubuntu on one at the 
start of TOP

99% of people are running one of these three: 

Windows, Mac OS, or Linux

Using VM's we can run other operating systems 
on a single machine

But the OS on a machine is not the only thing defining 
our machine, it has hardware components like: 

- Hard Disk 

- Processor

- Random Access Memory (RAM)

- Motherboard

- CPU 

- GPU 

- SSD 

And many more!!

These components are known as hardware components 

This is important to note because for our VM's to 
work, they need access to our hardware components 

Since a VM will act as if it's a unique machine itself 
it needs it's own machine parts 

What we'll do is borrow a bit of our main machines 
components so that the VM can function properly

VM's only borrow functionality when it's in use, 
after shutting down the VM we gain all of our 
resources back, with modern computers the 
difference in speed isn't that noticeable
